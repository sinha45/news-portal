    <p><span class="text-primary fw-bold fs-4">var:</span> keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows. Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization.</p>
    <p><span class="text-primary fw-bold fs-4">let:</span>In JavaScript, let is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variable. Usually, the var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript which is treated as a normal variable, but the variables declared using the let keyword are block scoped.</p>
    <p><span class="text-primary fw-bold fs-4">const:</span>Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be re-declared.</p>
